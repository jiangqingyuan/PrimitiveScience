# 状态

Program state
A program is said to have a state if it remembers previous events that have occurred. A program stores data in variables. At any given point, during the program's execution, we can look at the data that is currently in all the variables we have defined. The combined value in all these variables is what makes up the state of the program.
If we change one variable, the state of the program will also change. When we are talking about imperative programming, we mean that as soon as a statement changes the content of a variable, it has changed the program state.
